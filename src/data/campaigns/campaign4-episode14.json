When the Shapers' War started, and for the first time in thousands of years, elven druids actually were welcomed as some elves started to rebel. In one of the early speeches that was given to convince a family group of elves to come into the rebellion, the term 'menelas' was used to describe the highest ambitions of the faithful elves. That what they wanted to be was the flower dolls of the Goddess of Life forever. And it basically became a-- you don't want to be free. You don't want to find truth.
