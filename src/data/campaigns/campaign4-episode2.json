The reason you had to use Casimir is that Casimir is a smuggler. He could get a wagon with a trick compartment. He could get you something on a road out. The plan was you get the glyph to Thjazi. Thjazi has a way to basically Misty Step through the wall into the hidden compartment of the wagon. Casimir was not going to be able to show up with the wagon, but Cyd worked as a driver. That was like his above, as like a coach, wagon driver. So he was going to get the wagon into position where it would be within that short distance through the wall, drive on out of there. And Occtis and Thaisha were going to not be anywhere near the execution because they're highly visible. Thaisha's a member of the Circle of Ancients. Occtis is a member of the House Tachonis. But that would be an asset getting out of the city if you weren't near the execution anymore.",

Demons had always existed on Aram\u00e1n in some way or another. Other ancient beings, old and connected to the spirit. They say that giants walked this world before the gods arrived, and the gods defeated them when they arrived here. There are some types of beings that were not here before the gods were here because they were called, or sung into being, or came from whatever realm the gods came from, and these were the celestials. Their roles, beautiful, ethereal. The heralds and servants and warriors of the divine, crafted from the power of divine might themselves. When the gods died, the celestials went feral and became ravening, like monsters. To see a celestial is to see death itself, and their presence is felt almost nowhere in the world for in the aftermath of the Shapers' War, to leave one on the loose or running was a death sentence for that region, essentially.
