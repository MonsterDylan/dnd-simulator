It's a very drums in 'Jumanji' kind of-- You're like-- I think in this moment on that 25-- on that 25 and on that dirty 20, a residual of the magic that happened here, which, while you guys-- The mundane world is creeping back in. Dangerous people are out to hurt and kill a lot of you. However, there is still a lingering feeling of the numinous. What Bolaire and Murray just did is unbelievable. And it is itself, only possible because of what Occtis did, that Thaisha saw in the other realm, which was unbelievable. Which only happened because Thaisha interrupted whatever was supposed to happen. So, a chain reaction of extreme intercessions into a very delicate arcane process has occurred here. So when you're thinking, 'Is this a talisman? Is this where Occtis' life force is?', no. It's not one-to-one because this thing was supposed to effectively be desecrated or destroyed. And instead, due to the actions of yourself, Bolaire, Thaisha, Occtis, a thing that was supposed to be sacrilegiously destructed to accomplish whatever the ends of Primus Tachonis and the rest of Occtis' family were; was prevented. You, in other words, look at Occtis on that 25, which is a high, high bar to clear. You think what you have here is-- You would not have been able to construct the ritual capable of arriving, not with years of planning and resources could you have constructed a ritual to arrive here. Instead, what happened is, you guys hijacked a machine that a sorcerous family has had in the works for years; at the last possible second. And instead of driving it through the wall of whatever horrific purpose the Tachonis had in mind, like safely landed a tank on a rooftop. You took something that should not have done this, but at the last possible minute, perfectly aligned to bring Occtis back. What you also, I think, recognize is: Occtis is not-- Even with an incredible nat 20, resurrection defies the ability of any mortals living within Aram\u00e1n. But creating an undead creature that is possessed of its own heart and mind, has never been done before. And that's closer than anyone's ever gotten to a true resurrection in a long, long time. So all of which is to say, you can rule out his talisman, but you do think that there is a troubled-- You think that Occtis and this stone are interwoven. Magically, permanently. You don't know that that means he should have it. You don't know that that means that it's good for him. And on that 20 religion, Vaelus, I'll bring to you this other element here, which is: You know that the Stone of Nightsong is a relic of, effectively, like celestial requiem of the goddess of life. She didn't wish for any of her children to die, but even she could not prevent them from dying in injury or accident. So the Stone of Nightsong was crafted as basically a relic to celestials that did have to guide the tragic elves that died through the Shadowfell, to the final halls of the goddess of life. Within that, on that, you just recognized that whatever these arcanists have just done, has prevented the destruction of a relic of your order. And you can also see that it is tied purposefully, intimately to the existence and continued animation of young Occtis.",

The main road that diverges out from the Dvalmar Pass. So the Dvalmar Pass is the big pass that runs east from Dol-Makjar; that road you know doesn't lead to Gormalay. It doesn't lead to Timmony, the realm, the Kingdom of Timmony. You would be looking for probably two different roads or highways that go north. One of them is the Pilgrims' Road, which is this ancient dwarven road that goes over the mountaintops to some ancient holy sites. That place has been largely abandoned since the Goddess of the Forge was defeated. There's not a lot of pilgrims running around anymore. Then there's the King's Highway. That's the main road that leads to Timmon's Rock, which is the capital city of Timmony. That is the fastest road to where you're going. It's a big old highway. It stretches off of the Dvalmar Pass.
