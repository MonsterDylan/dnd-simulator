Deep in a writhing pit of entropy and destruction, the substance that made you was waiting for this world to be born so you could come and ruin it. You look at this knife, you are so drawn to it. You were shaped by the hand of the Shadow of Suffering, ancient demon whose voice you've heard this very night, and there's something in this knife, you are drawn to it and it has to do with pain, you're certain of it. That's what you're here to do. Contract with a mortal family of sorcerers be damned, you are here to hurt the world. You look in that knife and you start to attune to it and you see a mother's hand, some pumpkins and squash from a little mountainside garden, roasted and seasoned and covered in honey, fresh seeds, and you can hear the babbling of a nearby baby. This thing roasted to a point of softness, and you can see her cutting through with a knife, each cut going into something, making it a small each cut going into something, making it a small and perfect size to go into a little child's hand. Every little motion of the knife is a prayer, hoping that a thing she loves more than life itself will take a little morsel of food and get a little stronger, a little bigger, a little more ready for a world she can't predict. This knife has been an instrument of love for more times than you can count and you get lost in that memory. Where does Tyranny go in this memory, and what crosses her mind as she looks?",
