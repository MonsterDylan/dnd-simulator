You know that it was a sacred artifact of your goddess. But you are not, the Sisters of Sylandri are not researchers or archivists, they're warriors. So you've never necessarily had deep curiosity about the story of the Stone of Nightsong. It's enough to know that it's sacred. It's not your place to ask why it might be sacred or what it might mean. Everything of the goddess' means something. Someone could have told you that a single dead leaf of a fallen tree had been held once by her hand and it would've been sacred to you. But you certainly don't know its story. I think on a 20 insight, you walk out of there saying the joking thought that Vaelus has to herself, which is she's never really learned how to say hello or goodbye. You hold this thing that belonged to your goddess and you wonder how truthful it is that you've never learned to say goodbye.",
