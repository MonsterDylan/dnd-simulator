Their looks of determination, heroism, and strength carved forevermore into their faces. What hope they bear in their noble visages.

As the city comes to life over your own neighborhood, you see a flight of magpies, black wings, white breasts, take to the sky, flying over the stream as the mist rises on this gray day. The days have been mostly gray recently. The Guardian Wall, like much of Dol-Makjar, is a place dedicated to heroism, camaraderie, the struggle of the mortal world to make a brighter day.

He's fully in his right mind at this point after what he'd seen in the rural area surrounding what was happening at the crofters' village. He needed to come into town for a drink, which he rarely comes into the city, very rarely. And whispers on the wind said a familiar name was in trouble. And as he watched the execution unfold, in his mind's eye, he painted a picture of what could happen. The thing about Kattigan is he's unnerving to be around because there's no clue what's going to happen. You could get a drink, a handshake, a handful of coin, or a headbutt, you never know. And in his mind's eye, he sees this scenario where he jumps up on stage and slices down a guard and frees Thjazi and runs off, but catches arrows in the back because there's no way he could do this. And he knows he would die doing it, but it sounds like fun. So he's fantasizing, he's imagining. And as he imagines, the grip is tighter on his club. And you feel this sort of feral fight-or-flight energy. And Wulferic at his side nudges his hand and his grip lets go. As he comes out of this fantasy and scans the area, he sees Teor in the distance, watching, and he sees you because you're part of it. And he follows them to the funeral, watches them go inside and almost thinks about joining. And then he hears the cacophony of voices, that part in a wake where the quiet turns to reverie as people start to become comfortable and celebrates life. And he decides not to go. And in that moment, as he's turning to walk out, all of you step out of the funeral. So he decides to follow. And this is where he finds himself, not sure why he's here.",
